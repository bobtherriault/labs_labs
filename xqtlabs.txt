# These are labs invalid for the qt ide, e.g. because intended
# for JHS or other platform.
#
# all files are under ~addons
#
# to test from the command line, ensure the labs are installed, 
# then load the labs and call lab_jlab_ with the lab filename.
# For example:
#
#    load 'labs/labs' 
#    lab_jlab_ '~addons/labs/labs/core/intro.ijt'
